## Summary Statistics
- ‚úÖ **Present (Complete)**: 18 features (60%)
- üî∂ **Partial**: 7 features (23%) 
- ‚ùå **Missing**: 5 features (17%)

## High-Priority Gaps
1. **RL + Policy Engine**: Core missing functionality for advanced trading logic
2. **Simulation Studio**: Essential for strategy development and backtesting
3. **Trade Throttles/Cooldowns**: Critical risk management features
4. **Live RL Predictions**: Real-time AI inference capabilities
5. **Rationale & Journal**: User-facing trade reasoning and analysis tools

## Risk Assessment
- **Security**: ‚úÖ All security features are implemented and functional
- **Database**: ‚úÖ Schema supports most planned features, some extensions needed
- **API Keys**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires OpenAI API key (already configured)
- **External Dependencies**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Will need additional APIs for whale tracking, social sentiment
- **Token Costs**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Heavy AI usage may increase OpenAI costs
