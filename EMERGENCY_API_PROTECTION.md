# EMERGENCY: X API Protection Implementation
**Status**: CRITICAL - Only 100 posts/month (3 per day)
**Priority**: Implement immediately to prevent complete service loss

## Critical Risk Assessment
- **X API Free Tier**: 100 posts/month total
- **Daily Budget**: ~3 requests/day maximum  
- **Risk**: Complete loss of social sentiment if exceeded
- **Current Usage**: Unknown - could already be near limit

## Immediate Implementation Required

### 1. Emergency Rate Limiter (Deploy Now)
```typescript
// server/middleware/xApiProtection.ts
const X_API_EMERGENCY_LIMIT = {
  requests: 2,           // Maximum 2 per day
  window: 86400000,      // 24 hours
  blockDuration: 86400000 // 24 hour cooldown if exceeded
};
```

### 2. Smart Trigger System
- **Only activate X API on**:
  - BTC/ETH moves >15% in 1 hour
  - Major news events (manual trigger)
  - User specifically requests sentiment update
- **Never use for**: Background polling, routine sentiment checks

### 3. 24-Hour Caching
- Cache all X API responses for 24 hours minimum
- Serve stale data rather than making new requests
- Display "Last updated" timestamp to users

### 4. Monthly Usage Tracking
```typescript
// Track usage in database
- Daily X API calls made
- Monthly total (reset on 1st)
- Auto-disable at 90 calls/month
```

## Implementation Steps (Next Hour)

1. **Stop any current X API polling** - immediate pause
2. **Add emergency rate limiter** - 2/day hard limit  
3. **Implement volatility triggers** - only major market events
4. **Add usage dashboard** - monitor remaining calls
5. **Test with 1 single call** - verify system works

## Alternative Strategy
Consider disabling X API entirely until paper trading is validated with other sentiment sources (Reddit, CryptoPanic, Fear & Greed Index). The 100/month limit is too restrictive for continuous operation.

## Status Check Required
Immediately check: How many X API calls have already been made this month?
