# STEVIE TRAINING DAY - ITERATIVE BENCHMARK HARDENING

Complete system for versioned iterative training with automatic difficulty scaling and performance tracking.

## Overview

"Training Day" is Stevie's automated improvement system that continuously challenges him through increasingly difficult market scenarios. Each iteration runs a benchmark test, scales difficulty, retrains the model, and tracks version progression until performance improvements plateau.

## Key Features

### 🎯 Versioned Benchmarking
- **Benchmark Versions**: Start at 1.1, increment by 0.1 each iteration (1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 → 2.0)
- **Stevie Versions**: Patch version increments (1.4.0 → 1.4.1 → 1.4.2)
- **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics with improvement calculations
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Automatic progression through market complexity levels

### 🎚️ Difficulty Progression
- **Days**: Extended testing periods (7 → 14 → 21+ days)
- **Market Shocks**: Random price volatility injection
- **Noise Level**: Price movement noise up to 20%
- **Slippage**: Transaction cost simulation up to 1%
- **Complexity Factors**: Regime changes, correlation breakdown, extreme events

### 🔄 Training Loop
1. **Benchmark Test**: Run current version against difficulty level
2. **Performance Check**: Calculate improvement vs previous iteration
3. **Stopping Criteria**: Continue if improvement ≥ threshold (default 0.5%)
4. **Version Increment**: Bump benchmark and Stevie versions
5. **Retrain**: Simulate model retraining with specified epochs
6. **Repeat**: Until plateau or maximum iterations reached

## Architecture

### Core Components

**`benchmarkTest.ts`** - Versioned benchmark execution
- Synthetic market data generation with difficulty modifiers
- Comprehensive performance metric calculation
- Result storage and visualization
- Market regime detection and analysis

**`difficultyScheduler.ts`** - Version and difficulty management
- Semantic version progression (1.1 → 1.2 → 2.0)
- Exponential difficulty scaling with complexity factors
- Performance impact prediction and stopping criteria
- Milestone detection and roadmap generation

**`trainIterate.ts`** - Main training loop orchestration
- Automated benchmark → train → improve cycle
- Version tracking for both benchmark and Stevie
- Comprehensive iteration reporting and analysis
- Stopping criteria evaluation and trend analysis

**`trainingReporter.ts`** - Analysis and visualization
- Detailed performance breakdown with ASCII plots
- Historical session comparison and trend analysis
- Multi-session aggregate statistics
- Recommendation generation based on performance patterns

### Version Numbering System

**Benchmark Versions** (Difficulty Levels):
- Format: `Major.Minor` (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 1.9, 2.0)
- Increment: +0.1 per iteration, rolls over at .9 → next major
- Purpose: Track difficulty progression and test complexity

**Stevie Versions** (Model Iterations):
- Format: `Major.Minor.Patch` (e.g., 1.4.0, 1.4.1, 1.4.2)
- Increment: +1 patch version per successful training iteration
- Purpose: Track model improvement and training progression

**Why This System**:
- Clear separation between difficulty scaling and model versioning
- Semantic meaning: benchmark versions = test complexity, Stevie versions = model iterations
- Scalable: Can handle hundreds of iterations without confusion
- Traceable: Easy to correlate performance with specific versions

## Performance Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Total Return**: Percentage profit/loss over test period
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return measurement
- **Max Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Calmar Ratio**: Return vs maximum drawdown

### Analysis Metrics
- **Improvement**: Performance change vs previous iteration
- **Consistency**: Rate of positive improvements
- **Learning Efficiency**: Success rate × consistency rate
- **Performance Volatility**: Standard deviation of returns across iterations

## Difficulty Levels by Version

| Version | Description | Days | Noise | Shocks | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|------|-------|--------|------------|
| 1.1-1.3 | Beginner | 7-10 | 2-4% | 1-2 | Basic conditions |
| 1.4-1.6 | Intermediate | 11-15 | 4-7% | 2-3 | Moderate volatility |
| 1.7-1.9 | Advanced | 16-20 | 7-12% | 3-5 | High complexity |
| 2.0+ | Expert | 21+ | 12-20% | 5+ | Extreme conditions |

## Stopping Criteria

Training automatically stops when:
1. **Insufficient Improvement**: 3 consecutive iterations below threshold
2. **Maximum Iterations**: Reaches configured iteration limit
3. **Training Failures**: 2+ consecutive benchmark failures
4. **Performance Degradation**: Significant performance decline trend

## Integration with Existing Systems

Training Day integrates seamlessly with:
- **Existing RL Training**: Uses current simulation and training infrastructure
- **Performance Monitoring**: Results feed into production monitoring systems
- **Database Systems**: All results stored in PostgreSQL with proper indexing
- **CLI Framework**: Native integration with skippy CLI commands

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-Asset Training**: Extend beyond BTC to multiple cryptocurrencies
- **Real Market Integration**: Use actual historical data alongside synthetic
- **Distributed Training**: Parallel training across multiple instances
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Dynamic improvement requirements based on performance trends
- **Competition Mode**: Multiple Stevie versions competing simultaneously
