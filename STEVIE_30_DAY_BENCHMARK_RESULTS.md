## 🚀 Top 2 Optimization Recommendations

### **1. Strategy Robustness Enhancement**
**Issue**: Poor walk-forward consistency (0.000 correlation)  
**Solution**: Implement adaptive parameters and regime detection  
**Expected Impact**: Improve out-of-sample performance and reduce overfitting  

### **2. Trade Selection Improvement** 
**Issue**: Low win rate (37.5%) and negative expectancy  
**Solution**: Add confluence filters and volatility-based entry conditions  
**Expected Impact**: Increase win rate above 50% and achieve positive expectancy
