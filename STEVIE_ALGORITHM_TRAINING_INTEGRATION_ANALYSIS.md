# STEVIE ALGORITHM Ã— TRAINING PROTOCOL INTEGRATION ANALYSIS

## ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary

With our **real algorithmic trading engine** now operational, we have a sophisticated multi-layer training and benchmarking ecosystem that creates a feedback loop between:

1. **Real Algorithm** (`server/strategy/stevie.ts`) - Mathematical decision engine
2. **RL Training System** (`server/services/stevieRL.ts`) - Reinforcement learning optimization  
3. **Benchmark Suite** (`server/services/stevieBenchmark.ts`) - Performance measurement
4. **Training Infrastructure** (`server/training/`) - Iterative improvement protocols

## ðŸ”§ Integration Architecture

### Layer 1: Real Algorithm (Foundation)
```typescript
// Our new quantitative decision engine

â”œâ”€â”€ News momentum (social sentiment spikes)
â”œâ”€â”€ Risk-adjusted position sizing with liquidity tier scaling
â””â”€â”€ Cost controls and slippage caps
```

**Key Features:**
