## üèÜ Scoring System

### **Overall Score Calculation**
- Each test receives 0-100 points
- Tests are weighted by importance (shown above)
- Overall score = Sum of (test_score √ó test_weight)
- **Target: 75+ overall score for production readiness**

### **Category Scoring**
- **Personality**: 75+ (Brand consistency critical)
- **Analysis**: 80+ (Accuracy critical for trading)
- **RL Performance**: 70+ (Learning improvement focus)
- **User Satisfaction**: 80+ (User experience critical)
- **Technical Accuracy**: 90+ (Zero tolerance for calculation errors)

## üîÑ Usage Workflow

### **1. Initial Benchmark (Version 1.1)**
```bash
POST /api/stevie/benchmark/run
```
- Establishes baseline performance across all 15 tests
- Identifies initial strengths and improvement areas
- Provides first set of optimization recommendations

### **2. Algorithm Updates**
When making changes to Stevie's algorithm:
1. Update relevant code (personality, RL, analysis, etc.)
2. Increment version number
3. Run new benchmark with updated version

### **3. Version Comparison**
```bash
POST /api/stevie/benchmark/update-version
Body: {"version": "1.2"}
```
- Automatically runs benchmark with new version
- Compares against previous version (1.1)
- Shows score improvements/regressions
- Updates recommendations based on changes

### **4. Continuous Monitoring**
```bash
GET /api/stevie/benchmark/latest    # Get most recent results
GET /api/stevie/benchmark/history   # Get all version history
```
