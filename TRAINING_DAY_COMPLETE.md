## üéöÔ∏è VERSION NUMBERING SYSTEM EXPLAINED

### Benchmark Versions (Difficulty Levels)
- **Format**: Major.Minor (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, ... 1.9, 2.0)
- **Progression**: Increments by 0.1 each iteration, rolls over at .9
- **Purpose**: Tracks difficulty/complexity level of test conditions
- **Examples**:
  - v1.1-1.3: Beginner (7-10 days, 2-4% noise)
  - v1.4-1.6: Intermediate (11-15 days, 4-7% noise)
  - v1.7-1.9: Advanced (16-20 days, 7-12% noise)
  - v2.0+: Expert (21+ days, 12-20% noise, extreme conditions)

### Stevie Versions (Model Iterations)  
- **Format**: Major.Minor.Patch (1.4.0, 1.4.1, 1.4.2)
- **Progression**: Patch version increments per successful training
- **Purpose**: Tracks actual model improvement iterations
- **Benefit**: Clear separation between test difficulty and model progress

**Why This System**:
- **Scalable**: Can handle 100+ iterations without confusion
- **Meaningful**: Each version number represents specific difficulty/capability level
- **Traceable**: Easy correlation between performance and specific versions
- **Professional**: Industry-standard semantic versioning approach
