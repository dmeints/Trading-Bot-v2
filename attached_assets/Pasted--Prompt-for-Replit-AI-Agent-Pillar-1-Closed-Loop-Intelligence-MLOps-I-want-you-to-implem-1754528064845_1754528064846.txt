### ü§ñ Prompt for Replit AI Agent ‚Äî Pillar 1: Closed-Loop Intelligence & MLOps

I want you to implement a robust MLOps pipeline for the **Market Insight** and **Risk Assessor** agents so they continuously learn from real trading data and surface explainable insights.

---

#### 1. Automated Retraining Pipeline  
- Create a scheduled job (Cron or Replit Task) that:  
  1. **Fetches** all new analytics events (trades, PnL records, regime shifts) from the database since the last run.  
  2. **Preprocesses** them into the agent‚Äôs training format (features + labels).  
  3. **Triggers** a fine-tuning or retraining job using OpenAI Functions or your existing RL training scripts.  
  4. **Validates** the new model on held-out data and **publishes** it if performance (e.g. accuracy, Sharpe ratio) improves by at least 2%.  
- Store retraining metadata (timestamp, metrics, model version) in a new `model_runs` table.

#### 2. Hyperparameter Sweep Service  
- Build a CLI command `skippy sweep` that:  
  1. Accepts a JSON config of parameters to sweep (e.g. learning rate, batch size, risk thresholds).  
  2. **Spawns** parallel training jobs (locally or via Replit functions) across the parameter grid.  
  3. **Aggregates** results in a new `sweep_results` table with results and metrics for each permutation.  
- Add a ‚ÄúSweep Dashboard‚Äù page in the admin panel showing sortable/filterable sweep outcomes and best-performing configs.

#### 3. Drift Detection & Explainability  
- Instrument a drift-detection service that:  
  1. Monitors the distribution of key input features and model outputs over time (e.g. confidence scores, feature importances).  
  2. Calculates statistical drift metrics (e.g. KL divergence) daily.  
  3. **Alerts** via your `/metrics` endpoint and Replit alerts when drift exceeds a threshold.  
- Extend the **AI Insights** UI to show:  
  - A timeline of model performance (accuracy, Sharpe) and drift metrics.  
  - Top-5 feature-importance changes between the last two retraining runs.  
  - ‚ÄúRetrain Now‚Äù button to trigger an ad-hoc retraining job.

#### Deliverables  
1. **Retraining Cron job** code, database migrations for `model_runs` table, and scheduling config.  
2. **`skippy sweep` CLI** implementation with parallel job orchestration and `sweep_results` schema.  
3. **Drift-Detection Service** code, metric exporters, and alert rules.  
4. **Dashboard UI Pages** for Retraining History and Hyperparameter Sweeps, with charts for performance & drift.  
5. **Documentation updates** (`MLOPS.md`) explaining how to run, monitor, and extend the pipeline.

Run this end-to-end: scaffold code, apply migrations, schedule tasks, and update the UI. Return a summary of what was created, how to invoke each piece, and any manual steps required. ```
