### ü§ñ Prompt for Replit AI Agent ‚Äî Stevie Data Validation to Live Deployment Workflow

I want you to execute the next-phase workflow to validate data, run warm-up and full simulations, analyze results, integrate LLM explanations, and prepare for a live canary deployment. Run all steps end-to-end, then return a concise report of outcomes, metrics, and any manual follow-ups.

---

## 1. Data Validation  
- **Smoke-test CSVs**: load a few random rows from each `/data/historical/*.csv` (bars, depth, whales, sentiment, funding, events).  
- **Unit-test FeatureService**: call `featureService.getFeatures(symbol, timestamp)` for several timestamps; confirm valid `FeatureVector` outputs.

## 2. Warm-Up Simulation  
```bash
skippy simulate:auto \
  --days 7 \
  --max-iterations 3 \
  --stop-threshold 0.005

Run on a 7-day slice; verify end-to-end flow (data ingestion ‚Üí RLTradingEnv ‚Üí metrics ‚Üí recommendations).


3. Full 30-Day Auto-Tuning Loop

skippy simulate:auto \
  --days 30 \
  --max-iterations 10 \
  --stop-threshold 0.005

Execute the complete 30-day simulation and auto-tuning cycle; log all model_runs and applied tweaks.


4. Analysis & Iteration

Report:

skippy simulate:report --plot
skippy recommend --top 3

Review performance vs. iteration charts and top-3 hyperparameter suggestions; note any necessary tweaks.


5. LLM Explanations Integration

Hook ‚ÄúAsk Stevie‚Äù to fetch feature vectors on demand via /api/features, /api/sentiment, etc.

Prompt Stevie to explain trade decisions:

‚ÄúStevie, why did you buy 0.5 BTC at timestamp X? Show your feature analysis.‚Äù


6. Live Canary Deployment Prep

Merge enriched simulation env into LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED codepath.

Run a short paper-trade with enriched features; confirm no runtime errors.

Document steps to flip LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED=true for a small-capital canary test, monitor PnL, and use the ‚ÄúKill Switch‚Äù if needed.
