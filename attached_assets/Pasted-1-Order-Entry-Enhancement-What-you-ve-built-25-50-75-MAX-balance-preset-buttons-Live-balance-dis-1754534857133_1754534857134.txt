1. Order Entry Enhancement
What you’ve built:

25/50/75/MAX balance-preset buttons

Live balance display next to amount input

Real-time fee estimates & cost breakdown

Improved order-type dropdown

Industry comparison:

Binance combines presets with auto-sliders and live “cost vs. total equity” gauges; your presets match their speed, but you can go further by:

Auto-slider integration: allow drag handles on a percentage slider for fine-grained control.

Fee tiers: show dynamic maker/taker fee rates based on user tier.

TradingView’s trade ticket is lighter—it surfaces only balance and allows keyboard entry; consider adding:

Keyboard shortcuts (e.g. ↑/↓ to nudge amount, Enter to submit).

Quick-fill from chart: click on a price line to auto-populate the price field.

Actionable tweaks:

Add a 50%-to-MAX slider underneath your preset buttons for fluid adjustments.

Expose fee tier info (e.g. “0.10% maker / 0.12% taker”) in a tooltip.

Support keyboard entry enhancements: Tab order, ↑/↓ arrows to increment, and Enter to confirm.

2. Layout Preset System
What you’ve built:

“Classic Trading,” “Analytics-First,” “AI Copilot,” “Mobile-Optimized” presets

One-click restore default

Visual mini-previews of each preset

Industry comparison:

TradingView offers a handful of chart templates but no full-app presets—your system is more powerful.

Binance does not allow freeform panel arrangement; it opts for fixed tabs, which ensures consistency.

Actionable tweaks:

Introduce a “Favorites” preset: let users save a custom arrangement beyond the four defaults.

Provide auto-apply context: e.g. when on mobile, automatically switch to “Mobile-Optimized.”

Lock critical panels in some presets (e.g. always keep Order Entry visible in “Classic Trading”) to prevent accidental closure.

3. Trade Confirmation Flow
What you’ve built:

Full cost breakdown (amount, fees, slippage, total)

Estimated PnL impact

Risk warnings and color-coded visuals

Industry comparison:

Coinbase Pro uses a two-step flow: entry form → compact modal → final confirmation. It’s extremely lean.

Binance embeds the confirmation inline, with minimal pop-ups, prioritizing speed over detail.

Actionable tweaks:

Offer a “Fast Confirm” toggle for expert users that skips the modal entirely (with a keyboard shortcut to toggle safety).

If slippage is high, gray out the “Confirm” button until the user acknowledges the warning.

Add a “Preview on Chart” link in the modal that temporarily overlays the execution price and stop-loss levels on the chart behind.

5. Next Priority Improvements
Watchlist + Alert Panel

Dock a collapsible Watchlist on the sidebar with real-time price updates, “star” to favorite, and price/volume alert setup in one click.

Depth-of-Market Heatmap

Render the order book as a heatmap overlay beside the candlestick chart, similar to Binance’s DOM, so users can visually gauge liquidity.

Chart Indicator Library

Provide a sidebar of 10–15 most-used indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands). Allow users to toggle them on/off with a single click.
