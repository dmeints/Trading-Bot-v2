Layout & Information Architecture

TradingView uses a minimalist top nav with collapsible side panels: charts dominate, and tools (watchlists, indicators, drawing tools) live in context-sensitive sidebars.

Binance and Coinbase Pro employ a left sidebar for navigation (Markets, Trade, Derivatives, Wallet) and a top bar for account/actions. Their panels are tabbed rather than fully drag-and-drop, which keeps layout predictable.

Skippy’s collapsible sidebar plus draggable/resizable grid offers maximum flexibility, but at the cost of discoverability. Users of traditional trading platforms expect a more guided, consistent layout:

Recommendation: Retain grid customization for power users but add a set of fixed layout presets (“Classic Trading,” “Analytics-First,” “AI-Copilot”) that snap panels into familiar positions.

Trading Interface Design

Order Entry & Management

TradingView provides a compact order panel docked to the chart with quick toggle between order types, visible balance, and fee info.

Binance groups Market/Limit/OCO tabs into a tight form with live validation, one-click presets (e.g. 25%/50%/75% of balance), and a clear “Buy/Sell” distinction.

Skippy’s real-time form works, but adding balance presets, fee estimates, and one-click max-size buttons will speed execution and reduce cognitive load.

Market Data & Charts

TradingView’s charts are widget-rich: multiple drawing toolsets, indicator overlays, time-frame shortcuts.

Coinbase Pro offers simpler charts but with quick time-range buttons and depth overlays.

Skippy should elevate its “basic implementation” by:

Exposing multi-timeframe presets (1m, 5m, 1h, 1d) as one-click buttons

Embedding depth-of-market or order-book heatmap overlays

Surfacing indicator library (e.g. RSI, MACD) via a dropdown or sidebar

Position Tracking & Portfolio Views

Binance shows real-time P&L for each position, breach alerts, and color-coded profit/loss.

Coinbase Pro displays open orders, positions side by side with trade history.

Skippy could improve by adding:

Inline P&L sparklines next to each position

Stop-loss / take-profit markers on chart overlay

Quick-close buttons with confirmation on each open position

Real-Time Data Presentation

Leaders use micro-animations (e.g. price ticks fading), toast notifications for fills, and live price tooltips on hover.

Skippy’s WebSocket feed is solid; add:

Fading price highlights when new ticks arrive

Notification banner on order fills or strategy signals

Visual Design & User Experience

Color & Hierarchy

TradingView: dark theme with high-contrast candlesticks and neon accents for key controls.

Binance: deep charcoal base with bright green/red accents on P&L and orders.

Skippy’s shadcn/Tailwind palette is coherent; ensure your action buttons (Buy/Sell, Retrain) use a standout accent color (e.g. brand primary) and reserve red/green only for profits/losses.

Typography & Readability

Leaders use a compact, mono-digit font for price grids and a legible sans-serif for labels.

Skippy should adopt a variable-width font for body text and a discreet monospace for tables/grids.

Component Interactions

TradingView: panels snap/unsnap smoothly, with micro-animations on drag.

Skippy’s drag-and-drop grid works, but add snap-to-grid guides and drag handles that appear on hover for discoverability.

Mobile vs Desktop

Binance’s mobile app collapses side panels into bottom navigation and uses gesture-friendly charts.

Skippy should ensure its mobile breakpoint:

Switch sidebar to bottom tab bar

Use full-screen chart mode with swipe-in trade panel

Maintain ≥44 px touch targets on all interactive elements

Advanced Features Implementation

AI Insights

Modern platforms don’t yet integrate GPT-style agents, but Skippy’s contextual AI panel is unique. To match the polish of chart overlays:

Turn recommendations into annotated chart markers (e.g. “Buy signal: candle pattern + sentiment”)

Offer one-click “apply trade” from the AI panel

Plugin/Extensibility

Industry UIs are closed-source; your plugin concept is cutting-edge but can feel experimental.

Recommendation: Limit initial plugin exposure to data-source adapters only, and surface them in a simple dropdown rather than a full marketplace UI.

Customization

Binance allows order-book depth toggle, custom watchlists, and chart templates.

Skippy’s drag layout is powerful—add save/load layout presets and a “Restore Default” button to avoid broken dashboards.

Missing UI/UX Elements

Quick-Access Watchlist with pinned symbols and alerts.

Depth-of-Market / Order-Book Visualization adjacent to the main chart.

Market News / Sentiment Ticker banner (date-stamped headlines).

Trade Confirmation Modal summarizing fees, slippage, and PnL impact.

Improvement Recommendations

Introduce Layout Presets: prebuilt panel arrangements for common workflows.

Enhance Order Ticket: add balance presets (25/50/75%), fee estimates, and one-click max allocation.

Polish Charts: time-range buttons, indicator overlays, heatmap/depth views, and animated price ticks.

Elevate AI Insights: integrate signals directly on charts and allow “execute signal” with one click.

Save & Share Configs: let users export their chart + order workflows as sharable JSON.

By focusing on these concrete, battle-tested patterns from TradingView, Binance, and Coinbase Pro, Skippy can level up its UI/UX to feel instantly familiar to power users while retaining its unique AI-driven edge.
