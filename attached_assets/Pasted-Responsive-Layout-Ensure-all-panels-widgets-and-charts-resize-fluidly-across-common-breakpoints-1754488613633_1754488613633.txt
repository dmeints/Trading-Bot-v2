Responsive Layout

Ensure all panels, widgets, and charts resize fluidly across common breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Use CSS Grid or Flexbox patterns to maintain consistent gutters, margins, and alignment.

Adaptive Typography

Implement fluid/rem units or utility classes so text scales with container sizeâ€”no overflow or cut-off.

Define a typographic scale (e.g. text-sm â†’ text-xl) that adapts via media queries or clamp().

Scroll & Overflow Management

Place scroll bars only where needed (e.g. data tables, chat panels), and make them visible on hover/focus.

Prevent nested scroll conflicts: ensure inner scroll containers donâ€™t block outer page scrolling.

Refined HUD & Controls

Optimize the placement and sizing of buttons, inputs, and selectors for both mouse and touch.

Ensure consistent padding, hit-areas, and contrast across light/dark themes.

Inspiration & Best Practices

Research 3â€“5 web apps with similar dashboards (e.g. TradingView, Binance, Coinbase Pro, Robinhood).

Summarize key layout patterns and UI behaviors they use for responsiveness and scrolling.

Provide code or Tailwind examples inspired by those patterns.

ðŸ”§ Tasks
Audit Existing Components

Scan our React components and Tailwind classes for fixed widths/heights or hard-coded pixel typography.

Identify places where overflow is mishandled or scrollbars donâ€™t appear.

Apply Responsive Patterns

Replace fixed sizes with relative (%, vw/vh, rem, clamp()) or Tailwind responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:).

Use min-max grid templates and Flexbox wrappers to let widgets grow or shrink.

Implement Fluid Typography

Define a root font scale using clamp(â€¦) or Tailwindâ€™s fluid type plugin.

Apply across headings, labels, and body text so nothing overflows at smaller widths.

Refactor Scroll Containers

Wrap scrollable areas in well-scoped <div className="overflow-auto"> with max-h-[â€¦] and visible scrollbars.

Ensure outer containers (<main>, <section>) use overflow-hidden when appropriate.

Gather & Document Examples

Pull screenshots or live URLs of 3â€“5 reference apps.

Note their breakpoint strategies, scroll-cue designs, and typography scales.

Provide a brief style guide or component snippets to emulate those UX patterns.

ðŸ“¦ Deliverables
PR with updated React/Tailwind code implementing the above refinements.

Responsive design spec (markdown) listing breakpoints, font scales, grid layouts, and overflow rules.

Reference gallery (links or images) of 3â€“5 apps, annotated with the patterns weâ€™re adopting.

Before/After screenshots or animated GIFs demonstrating improved resizing and scroll behavior.
