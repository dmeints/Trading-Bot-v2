# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client is built with React 18 and Vite, using a component-based architecture. UI components are developed with shadcn/ui (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS). Zustand manages client-side state, TanStack Query handles server state, and Wouter is used for routing. Custom WebSocket hooks facilitate real-time market data and AI agent updates. The design prioritizes mobile-first responsiveness, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance), and performance optimization. It includes enhanced order entry, professional layout presets, advanced trading components (e.g., watchlist, depth-of-market, chart indicators), and comprehensive drawing tools.

## Backend Architecture
The server follows a RESTful API design using Express.js with middleware for logging, authentication, and error handling. Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database interactions with PostgreSQL. A WebSocket server enables real-time communication. Core features include a multi-agent AI system for market analysis, news sentiment, trading decisions, and risk assessment, alongside a trading engine for execution and position management. The architecture emphasizes scalability, security (sub-200ms API responses, authenticated sessions), and observability with distributed tracing and Prometheus-compatible metrics.

## Data Storage Solutions
PostgreSQL is the primary database, with comprehensive schemas for users, trading data, and AI activities. Drizzle Kit manages schema migrations. A vector database is integrated for OpenAI embeddings, enabling trade similarity search and contextual insights, with automated indexing.

## Authentication and Authorization
Replit's OpenID Connect (OIDC) via Passport.js handles secure authentication. Server-side sessions are stored in PostgreSQL. Route-level authorization protects endpoints, and user management includes automatic creation and profile synchronization with Replit accounts.

## AI System Architecture
The platform features Stevie, an advanced AI trading companion with comprehensive personality and learning systems. This includes:
- **Stevie Personality System**: A complete persona with backstory, tone guidelines, and varied message variations for all interaction types.
- **LLM Conversational Interface**: OpenAI GPT-4o integration with function calling for portfolio analysis, trade explanations, and strategy suggestions.
- **Reinforcement Learning Strategy**: A full RL trading environment with PPO/DQN agents, composite reward functions, and continuous learning.
- **Context Management**: A sliding window memory of 1,000 tokens plus key trade events for personalized conversations.
- **UI Personality Integration**: All notifications, toasts, and interactions use Stevie's encouraging, data-driven personality.
- **Feedback & Monitoring System**: Includes thumbs-up/down feedback, weekly performance reports, and adaptive risk alerts.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Continuous market data processing with pattern recognition and personality-infused insights.
- **Performance Learning**: Closed-loop learning from user feedback and trading outcomes for continuous improvement.
- **Advanced Multi-Modal Trading System**: Features multi-modal signal fusion (news, on-chain, social sentiment), dynamic risk management (Kelly Criterion, volatility scaling), adversarial training for robustness, and real-time explainability via LLM-powered trade reasoning.
- **Multi-Mind Transcendence System**: Incorporates 5 distinct Stevie personalities (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omega) with a competitive evolution system for trading battles, breeding, and mutation algorithms for knowledge transfer.
- **Training Day System**: Provides an iterative benchmark hardening loop with version tracking for continuous improvement of Stevie models.

## Trading Engine Design
The trading engine supports:
- **Paper Trading**: Full simulation with realistic market conditions.
- **Position Management**: Real-time tracking of open positions and P&L.
- **Order Types**: Support for market, limit, and stop orders.
- **Risk Management**: Integrated controls and position sizing based on user risk tolerance.

## Core Trading Components
The system integrates a Market Insight Agent, Risk Assessment System, Real-time Analysis, Strategy Backtesting, Performance Learning, and Portfolio Management.

## Extensibility and Developer Experience
The platform features a comprehensive four-point plugin architecture (data connectors, signal transformers, UI panels, trading strategies) with a visual strategy builder, a plugin marketplace, and automatic plugin discovery with hot-reloading. It includes a unified CLI toolkit with management commands and OpenAPI documentation for structured API versioning.

## Deployment Architecture
Features lazy initialization of AI services to optimize startup and resource management in production. Includes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline, performance monitoring, and robust operational excellence features like distributed tracing and Prometheus-compatible metrics.
