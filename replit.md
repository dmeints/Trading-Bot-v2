# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client is built with React 18 and Vite. It features a component-based architecture using shadcn/ui (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS) for UI. Zustand manages client-side state, TanStack Query handles server state, and Wouter is used for routing. Custom WebSocket hooks facilitate real-time market data and AI agent updates.

## Backend Architecture
The server follows a RESTful API design using Express.js. It includes middleware for logging, authentication, and error handling. Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database interactions with PostgreSQL. A WebSocket server enables real-time communication. The core features include a multi-agent AI system for market analysis, news sentiment, trading decisions, and risk assessment, alongside a trading engine for execution and position management.

## Data Storage Solutions
PostgreSQL is the primary database, featuring comprehensive schemas for users, trading data, and AI activities. It utilizes appropriate data types for financial precision and JSONB for metadata. Drizzle Kit manages schema migrations.
