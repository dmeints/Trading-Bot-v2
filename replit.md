# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client is built with React 18 and Vite, utilizing a component-based architecture. UI components are built using shadcn/ui (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS). Zustand manages client-side state, TanStack Query handles server state, and Wouter is used for routing. Custom WebSocket hooks facilitate real-time market data and AI agent updates. The design prioritizes mobile-first responsiveness, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance), and performance optimization with a target bundle size under 450KB. It includes enhanced order entry, professional layout presets, advanced trading components (e.g., watchlist, depth-of-market, chart indicators), and comprehensive drawing tools.

## Backend Architecture
The server follows a RESTful API design using Express.js with middleware for logging, authentication, and error handling. Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database interactions with PostgreSQL. A WebSocket server enables real-time communication. Core features include a multi-agent AI system for market analysis, news sentiment, trading decisions, and risk assessment, alongside a trading engine for execution and position management. The architecture is designed for scalability, security (sub-200ms API responses, authenticated sessions), and observability with distributed tracing and Prometheus-compatible metrics.

## Data Storage Solutions
PostgreSQL is the primary database, with comprehensive schemas for users, trading data, and AI activities. Drizzle Kit manages schema migrations. A vector database is integrated for OpenAI embeddings, enabling trade similarity search and contextual insights, with automated indexing.

## Authentication and Authorization
Replit's OpenID Connect (OIDC) via Passport.js handles secure authentication. Server-side sessions are stored in PostgreSQL. Route-level authorization protects endpoints, and user management includes automatic creation and profile synchronization with Replit accounts.

## AI System Architecture
The platform features Stevie, an advanced AI trading companion with comprehensive personality and learning systems:
- **Stevie Personality System**: Complete persona with backstory, tone guidelines, and 25+ message variations for all interaction types
- **LLM Conversational Interface**: OpenAI GPT-4o integration with function calling for portfolio analysis, trade explanations, and strategy suggestions
- **Reinforcement Learning Strategy**: Full RL trading environment with PPO/DQN agents, composite reward functions, and continuous learning
- **Context Management**: Sliding window memory of 1,000 tokens plus key trade events for personalized conversations
- **UI Personality Integration**: All notifications, toasts, and interactions use Stevie's encouraging, data-driven personality
- **Feedback & Monitoring System**: Thumbs-up/down feedback, weekly performance reports, and adaptive risk alerts
- **Real-time Analysis**: Continuous market data processing with pattern recognition and personality-infused insights
- **Performance Learning**: Closed-loop learning from user feedback and trading outcomes for continuous improvement

## Trading Engine Design
The trading engine supports:
- **Paper Trading**: Full simulation with realistic market conditions.
- **Position Management**: Real-time tracking of open positions and P&L.
- **Order Types**: Support for market, limit, and stop orders.
- **Risk Management**: Integrated controls and position sizing based on user risk tolerance.

## Core Trading Components
The system integrates several core components including a Market Insight Agent, Risk Assessment System, Real-time Analysis, Strategy Backtesting, Performance Learning, and Portfolio Management.

## Extensibility and Developer Experience
The platform features a comprehensive four-point plugin architecture (data connectors, signal transformers, UI panels, trading strategies) with a visual strategy builder, a plugin marketplace, and automatic plugin discovery with hot-reloading. It includes a unified CLI toolkit with 25+ management commands and OpenAPI documentation for structured API versioning.

## Deployment Architecture
Features lazy initialization of AI services to optimize startup and resource management in production. Includes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline, performance monitoring, and robust operational excellence features like distributed tracing and Prometheus-compatible metrics.
