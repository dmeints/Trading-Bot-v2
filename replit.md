# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client is built with React 18 and Vite. It features a component-based architecture using shadcn/ui (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS) for UI. Zustand manages client-side state, TanStack Query handles server state, and Wouter is used for routing. Custom WebSocket hooks facilitate real-time market data and AI agent updates.

## Backend Architecture
The server follows a RESTful API design using Express.js. It includes middleware for logging, authentication, and error handling. Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database interactions with PostgreSQL. A WebSocket server enables real-time communication. The core features include a multi-agent AI system for market analysis, news sentiment, trading decisions, and risk assessment, alongside a trading engine for execution and position management.

## Data Storage Solutions
PostgreSQL is the primary database, featuring comprehensive schemas for users, trading data, and AI activities. It utilizes appropriate data types for financial precision and JSONB for metadata. Drizzle Kit manages schema migrations.

## Authentication and Authorization
Replit's OpenID Connect (OIDC) via Passport.js handles secure authentication. Server-side sessions are stored in PostgreSQL. Route-level authorization protects endpoints, and user management includes automatic creation and profile synchronization with Replit accounts.

## AI System Architecture
The platform features a practical AI system designed for real-world trading:
- **Market Insight Agent**: Unified AI agent providing technical analysis, sentiment analysis, and news interpretation.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Continuous market data processing with pattern recognition and trend identification.
- **Risk Assessment**: Automated portfolio risk evaluation and position sizing recommendations.
- **Strategy Backtesting**: Historical performance validation for trading strategies.
- **Performance Learning**: System learns from successful trades and market patterns.
The AI system focuses on practical trading insights and measurable performance improvements.

## Trading Engine Design
The trading engine supports:
- **Paper Trading**: Full simulation with realistic market conditions.
- **Position Management**: Real-time tracking of open positions and P&L.
- **Order Types**: Support for market, limit, and stop orders.
- **Risk Management**: Integrated controls and position sizing based on user risk tolerance.

## Core Trading Components
- **Market Insight Agent**: Unified AI providing technical analysis, sentiment analysis, and news interpretation
- **Risk Assessment System**: Automated portfolio risk evaluation and position sizing recommendations  
- **Real-time Analysis**: Continuous market data processing with pattern recognition and trend identification
- **Strategy Backtesting**: Historical performance validation for trading strategies with measurable results
- **Performance Learning**: System learns from successful trades and market patterns to improve recommendations
- **Portfolio Management**: Multi-position tracking with real P&L calculations and risk metrics
- **Code Splitting Architecture**: Optimized frontend with lazy loading for improved performance

## API Infrastructure
Includes routes for RL inference, policy management, simulation services, and journal analytics.

## Deployment Architecture
Features lazy initialization of AI services, where services are initialized only when first requested via API endpoints, optimizing startup and resource management for production environments.
